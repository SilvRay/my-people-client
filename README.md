# MyPeople
Simple family app created with Node.js, React and MongoDB

## Introduction
It is a family oriented social network. You can organize family meals, movie nights, game afternoons, outings or even serious discussions. Obviously, you can post photos that only those who belong to the group will be able to see.
I came up with this idea for the final 4-week project of my bootcamp because I wanted an app that my loved ones and I could use on a daily basis to strenghten ties.
